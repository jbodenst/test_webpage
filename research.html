                Investigating the possible binary origin of Be stars
            </h2>
            <p class="text-justify pb-2 leading-tight"> About 20% of the massive galactic B stars are classical Be stars, observationally classified as such because their B-star spectrum is dominated by strong emission lines. While it has been shown that the formation of a circumstellar decretion disk, in which the emission originates, is linked to fast rotation of the central star, the origin of the rapid rotation remains unclear.</p>

            <div class="flex flex-col md:w-9/12">
                <p class="text-justify leading-tight pb-2"> Different channels for the origin of the Be phenomenon have been proposed. One of them is based on binarity, proposing that Be stars are the mass gainers in post-mass-transfer binary systems. Apart from gaining mass, the stars also gained angular momentum, spinning them up to almost critical rotation rates. If the binary channel is the dominating one in the formation of massive Be stars, two clear and testable predictions emerge:
				<ul class="list-decimal list-outside pl-8 leading-tight">
		        	<li> there should be a lack of Be stars in close binary systems with main-sequence (MS) companions </li>
		            <li> Be stars in binaries should have exotic companions such as envelope-stripped Helium stars, neutron stars and black holes </li>
		        </ul>
                <p class="text-justify pb-2 leading-tight">  In a literature study of a sample of ~300 massive Be stars (with spectral types B1.5 and earlier) in the Milky Way, we found that there is a clear lack of reported Be stars in binary systems with close main-sequence companions. While the sample is inhomogeneous, this gives a first hint that the binary channel might be dominating in the formation of massive Be stars. </p>

Based on their position in the color-magnitude diagram, they are prime candidates for binary interaction products. Using the multi-epoch nature of the MUSE observations, we identify binary systems in the cluster.
